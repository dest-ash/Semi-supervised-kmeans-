# __Semi-supervised-kmeans__

In this project, we want to develop a semi supervised approach to kmeans++.

This project consists of the following parts:
- creating kmeans algorithm and comparing it with that of sklearn. Based on lloyd approach.
- creating kmeans ++
- creating semi supervised kmeans ++:
  - using pseudo labelling to classify the data between labelled and unlabelled
  
- mathematical proofs of said algorithms.
 
 
Datasets:
The algorithms are applied on :
- Iris dataset (population 150)
- A larger dataset on customer segmentation (population 60366)
